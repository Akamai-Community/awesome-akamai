The Akamai GitHub Community is a place for developers working with Akamai to share helpful code and projects. The Awesome Akamai repository is a curated list of all the cool things related to Akamai products, tools, templates, and resources. This includes a list of links to official Akamai products as well as community projects and resources.

Any GitHub user can make a pull request to contribute to the repo. The Akamai Developer Advocacy team reviews each incoming request in order to maintain a safe and welcoming space with quality contributions for everyone. Below, we’ve laid out our code of conduct (CoC) and [GitHub’s community guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

-   Be accepting: Developers come from all walks of life and may have different experiences, view points, countries of origin, etc. Diversity leads to more variety in code and tools. Embrace it! Content and comments that discriminate against community members, based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, country of origin, religious beliefs, etc. are not tolerated.
    
-   Be respectful: Going with the theme from the bullet above, be polite and respectful of others. A welcoming atmosphere encourages everyone to participate, leading to more contributions for everyone to enjoy.
    
-   Check for quality: We don’t expect your suggested code to be flawless, but before suggesting for something to be added to the repository, make sure that it works as intended and without major issues. For a tool or resource to provide value to others, it needs to be functional.
    
-   Don’t suggest harmful content: Don’t submit pull requests for malicious content or code that alters Akamai’s products in any way. Pull requests that are harmful are subject to moderation.
    

### Violation Consequences

If you do not comply with the CoC, your contribution pull request may be denied. Furthermore, if your content violates GitHub’s policies, it may be reported to GitHub.

### Reporting Violations
